## **Description**: 

This package includes the code of the MR-EMO for solving migration resettlement problem. This package is free for academic usage. You can run it at your own risk. For other purposes, please contact Prof. Chao Qian (qianc@nju.edu.cn). 

This package was developed by Miss. Dan-Xuan Liu (liudx@lamda.nju.edu.cn). For any problem concerning the code, please feel free to contact her.

## Python Code:

 - `methods.py` contain all the algorithms in the expriements
 - `models.py` contain all the migration models in the paper
 - `num_localties.py` is the main python code to run the experiment of varying the number of localties. The same rule to other num_***.py file.

## Execution

#### Run the algorithms:

```
python run_locality_gsemo.py
```

All the default parameters are set based on the paper. You can change them in the code.
